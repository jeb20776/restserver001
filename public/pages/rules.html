<h2>Part 1:  Pick 8 Teams</h2>
<h3>Each of you will pick eight different teams with the following rules.</h3>

															
															
<li>1) You must pick at least one team from each region.</li>
<li>2) You cannot pick more than three teams from one region.</li>

															
<p>
  Scoring begins with the round two games that will be played on Thursday (March 19).  Tuesday (March 17) and Wednesday (March 18) games will not count in the scoring.															
Scores will be calculated as follows:
</p>															
															
      Example															
       If Connecticut is a #6 seed and they win 2 games,															
       18 points are scored.															
        (6 * 1) + (6 * 2) = 18 															
															
      Example															
       If Binghamton University is a #10 seed and they win 3 games,															
       60 points are scored.															
        (10 * 1) + (10 * 2) + (10 * 3) = 60															
															
        There are bonus points for the following categories that will be added to the above calculations.															
															
        Championship Team: + 20 															
        Reaching Championship Game: + 10 															
        Reaching Final Four: + 5 															
															
      Example - Team Receiving Bonus Points															
       If Florida is a #1 seed and they win the championship,															
       41 points are scored.															
        (1 * 1) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 4)+ (1 * 5)+ (1 * 6) + 20 = 41
